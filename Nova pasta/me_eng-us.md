# Hi I'm Douglas
# and this is a short story about me.
---
## Today I work in the labor market as an electronics technician.
## and I am introduced in the area of installations of fire stations and CFTV systems.
## But it all started when I was 12 years old and I already liked to take apart the electronic peripherals at home.
## until I found myself doing my technical course at the age of 20 in mechatronics and had my first contact with programming.
## From there I didn't stop, and went searching the contents until I found the DIO platform.
## and now i want to go to college to study 
## computer science.
